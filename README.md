# eGradDaffoDyl
Link to eGrad Wiki, a project I worked on

I can't link the actual repro because that is private code for the company I worked for, but if you would like to see some of the things I was a part of follow the link. You can also click on the learn more button to see some of the actual screens.

I primarlily worked on the front end of the project, but also worked on the back end as needed.
